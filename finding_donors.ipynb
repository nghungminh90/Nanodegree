    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "Answer: \n",
    "Support Vector Machines (SVM):\n",
    "• Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Before the appearing of deep learning, SVM is used a lot for face detection, handwriting recognition, image classification, Bioinformatics etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "• What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is useful for both Linearly Seperable(hard margin) and Non-linearly Seperable(soft margin) data. The only thing to do is to come up with the optimal penalty variable C.\n",
    "- According to sklearn page, SVM is still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.\n",
    "- Uses a subset of training points in the decision function (called support vectors), so it is also memory efficient\n",
    "\n",
    "• What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "\n",
    "- It's blackbox which is hard to interpret\n",
    "- Time consuming\n",
    "- Perform poorly and overfit when when the data is very noisy or overlaps too much. \n",
    "\n",
    "• What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "-  The model can still be a good candidate as there seems to be some features in the data that can more clearly define the income level boundary. \n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees:\n",
    "• Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are a lot of use cases of DecisionTree in classification problems. For example, they support the business's decision making whether continue conducting the market's test or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "• What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "\n",
    "- It's really easy to interpret as well as explain to someone who has no background in technical. \n",
    "- Uses a white box model. If a given situation is observable in a model, the explanation for the condition is easily explained by boolean logic.\n",
    "- Possible to validate a model using statistical tests. That makes it possible to account for the reliability of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "• What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision-tree learners can create over-complex trees that do not generalise the data well which leads to overfitting. \n",
    "- Decision trees can be unstable because small variations in the data might result in a completely different tree being generated. This problem is mitigated by using decision trees within an ensemble.\n",
    "- Decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate\n",
    "\n",
    "• What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we can tune the parameters well, DecisionTree should generate valuable results. But in this example, i won't try to tune parameters and see how large the difference of F1score between training test & test set\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble Methods (Bagging, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting):\n",
    "\n",
    "• Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensemble Methods are particularly good at predictive tasks, and due to their general purpose nature can be applied to many different situations. One real world example which i have found is \"An ensemble learning based model for real estate project classification\" (https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82193826.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "• What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The major strength of Ensemble Methods: for example in Random Forest/Adabooster, you can choose which features are important. Furthermore, It can get more accurate predictions that each model individually as well as help in generalization/robustness which reduce overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "• What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Adabooster, it's really sensitive if there are outliers. The other problems of Ensemble methods are that they require a lot of storage and computation because it requires a lot of different models to combine.\n",
    "\n",
    "• What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "- I want to try to compare how differences between the SVM, DecisionTree and Ensemble Method. Also AdaBoost is good for this problem because it will be able to take the full dataset and be able to generate a strong learner by analyzing the relationships between the various features and their effect\n",

The AdaBoost Classifier takes base learning algorithms the default is a Decision Tree Classification and trains many instances of a Classifier with simple hypotheses called the weak learners. The hypotheses are then taken by the Boosting algorithm and weighted to give greater importance to more difficult predictions, resulting in a strong hypothesis that accurately generalizes based on the given data. \n",

By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \\$50,000.\n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
